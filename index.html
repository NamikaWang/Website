    <p>Today we learned in class how to push our website and different codes we can run. On a google slide we learned about the engineering process as well as embedding in our websites. I changed the color of the background on my website and uploaded a picture on my website.</p>

    <p></p>So far in class we have done two quizes, one about mechanical engineering and the other was a saftey quiz. We have already made a CAD for our Rube Goldberg project as well as a CAD for a home applience. My group and I have started on our physical Rube Goldburg project, we have started to make the pipes and slopes out of cardboard. </p>
    <p>This is a picture of the draft for the Rube Golberg project:</p>

    <p>This week we worked on our Rube Goldberg Project which we used two slopes, wheel, and axel for the project. A difficulty we overcame was that the marble kept falling off of the pipes so we fixed this problem by changing the slope. I brought two differnt cars as the wheel and axel, one heavier than the other, we found that the lighter one stayed put better than the heavier one. The marble rolled down to hit the car which had a needle attatched to it with rolled into the ballon, popping it. </p>
    <p>This is our video of the Rube Goldberg project:</p>

    <p> This week we did a paper boat challenge where we made a boat only made of paper which had to float for 3 minutes with metal weighing it down. My group's boat stayed afloat after 3 mintues and likely could have lasted longer. We also disected a computer and identified many things such as the CPU and RAM. I learned that the CPU executes instructions of a computer program and the RAM temporarily stores information received. </p> 
    <p>This is the result of our disection:</p>

    <p>This week we stared class with a computer engineering quiz, then made a functional prosthetic hand from a pencil, tape, string, and cardboard. The instructions were to make a cardboard prosthetic hand that can pick up a plastic water bottle. A difficulty we encountered was that the water bottle would not stay in place as we tried picking it up. We fixed this problem by adding a "thumb" that made the water bottle stay in place. The thumb was a colored pencil that we poked through the palm of the prosthetic hand which, to our suprise, made the water bottle stay in place very well.</p>
    <p>This is the video of the Prosthetic Hand picking up a plastic water bottle:</p>

    <p>This week we did a Bioengineering quiz. Then did our CAD for our new project, a bottle rocket. We put a cone at the tip of the bottle for less drag considering aerodynamics. I learned that I could search up basic objects such as a bottle to use for my CAD which made the result much more similar to how the final project will look. </p>

      <p>The same week we made our CAD, we made the product as well. We hot glued cardboard pieces such as a cone and spoilers to make the aerodynamics better. Later we found that the spoliers were unnessasary and actualy weighted the rocket down which was actualy a hindered the rocket instead of benefiting it.</p>

       <P>I was absent this week but my group made a water bottle filter made out of a water bottle, rocks, sand, and a cotton ball. They cut the bottle in half, so the top was turned over and the bottle top was resting on the botom half of the water bottle. Cotton was stuffed at the narrow tip of the bottle top then rocks, sand, and more rocks were layered to make a filter. Water is poured on the rocks which strains through the sand and rockes then is finaly filtered through the cotton that drips out to the bottom.  </p>

        <p>This week we made three CADs are a bread board. The first one was simple, one LED, a 3V battery, breadboard, and one resistor. The second was three LEDs, a 9V battery, three resistors, and bread board. Tne last one was the same as the second but with only one resistor. Some difficulties I encountered were the LEDs not lighting up due to incorrect wiring, not enough voltage, and not enough resistance. I fixed these issues by changing the resistance to a higher or lower number and changing the wiring.</p>
