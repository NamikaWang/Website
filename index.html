    <p>Today we learned in class how to push our website and different codes we can run. On a google slide we learned about the engineering process as well as embedding in our websites. I changed the color of the background on my website and uploaded a picture on my website.</p>

    <p></p>So far in class we have done two quizes, one about mechanical engineering and the other was a saftey quiz. We have already made a CAD for our Rube Goldberg project as well as a CAD for a home applience. My group and I have started on our physical Rube Goldburg project, we have started to make the pipes and slopes out of cardboard. </p>
    <p>This is a picture of the draft for the Rube Golberg project:</p>

    <p>This week we worked on our Rube Goldberg Project which we used two slopes, wheel, and axle for the project. A difficulty we overcame was that the marble kept falling off of the pipes so we fixed this problem by changing the slope. I brought two differnt cars as the wheel and axle, one heavier than the other, we found that the lighter one stayed put better than the heavier one. The marble rolled down to hit the car which had a needle attatched to it with rolled into the ballon, popping it. </p>
    <p>This is our video of the Rube Goldberg project:</p>

    <p> This week we did a paper boat challenge where we made a boat only made of paper which had to float for 3 minutes with metal weighing it down. My group's boat stayed afloat after 3 mintues and likely could have lasted longer. We also disected a computer and identified many things such as the CPU and RAM. I learned that the CPU executes instructions of a computer program and the RAM temporarily stores information received. </p> 
    <p>This is the result of our disection:</p>

    <p>This week we stared class with a computer engineering quiz, then made a functional prosthetic hand from a pencil, tape, string, and cardboard. The instructions were to make a cardboard prosthetic hand that can pick up a plastic water bottle. A difficulty we encountered was that the water bottle would not stay in place as we tried picking it up. We fixed this problem by adding a "thumb" that made the water bottle stay in place. The thumb was a colored pencil that we poked through the palm of the prosthetic hand which, to our suprise, made the water bottle stay in place very well.</p>
    <p>This is the video of the Prosthetic Hand picking up a plastic water bottle:</p>

    <p>This week we did a Bioengineering quiz. Then did our CAD for our new project, a bottle rocket. We put a cone at the tip of the bottle for less drag considering aerodynamics. I learned that I could search up basic objects such as a bottle to use for my CAD which made the result much more similar to how the final project will look. </p>

      <p>The same week we made our CAD, we made the product as well. We hot glued cardboard pieces such as a cone and spoilers to make the aerodynamics better. Later we found that the spoliers were unnessasary and actualy weighted the rocket down which was actualy a hindered the rocket instead of benefiting it.</p>

       <P>I was absent this week but my group made a water bottle filter made out of a water bottle, rocks, sand, and a cotton ball. They cut the bottle in half, so the top was turned over and the bottle top was resting on the botom half of the water bottle. Cotton was stuffed at the narrow tip of the bottle top then rocks, sand, and more rocks were layered to make a filter. Water is poured on the rocks which strains through the sand and rockes then is finaly filtered through the cotton that drips out to the bottom.  </p>

<p>This week we made three CADs are a bread board. The first one was simple, one LED, a 3V battery, breadboard, and one resistor. The second was three LEDs, a 9V battery, three resistors, and bread board. Tne last one was the same as the second but with only one resistor. Some difficulties I encountered were the LEDs not lighting up due to incorrect wiring, not enough voltage, and not enough resistance. I fixed these issues by changing the resistance to a higher or lower number and changing the wiring.</p>

 <p>This week we covered business engineering. We had to come up with an original idea that solved a problem in our everyday life. We came up with the "Cool Kit". It is an everyday essentials kit that is customizable. It consists of a pouch which could be a variety of different patterns and colors which is inique to each individual. It has everyday essentials such as toothpaste, deodorant, and hair ties. The items in each pouch is chosen by the customer. The original pouch costs $15 and contains 10 items. The upgraded pouch is $25 and contains 15 items which are different and more desirable.  </p>

         <center><p>Spaghetti Bridge Project</p></center>
         <ol type="1">
  <li>The weight of the bridge was 32.7 grams.</li>
  <li>The weight held by our bridge was 447 grams of water.</li>
  <li>The ratio of weight of bridge to weight held is 13.6.</li>
  <li>The base of spaghetti contributed the most weight to the bridge.</li>
  <li>The design was inspired by reasearch online from other experiments.</li>
  <li>The design worked well and held a good amount of weight but it held less than the trial bridge.</li>
  <li>The design held well but the sides were too thin which caused the bridge to fall.</li>
  <li>As the designed failed due to the sides being too thin, we should have put less spaghetti in the middle and instead have used it to reinforce the sides.</li>

<p>On this week, we made Oobleck, which is a non-Newtonian fluid; it has properties of both liquids and solids. It is made out of cornstarch and water and it can behave like a solid or a liquid depending on how much pressure you apply. When you don't use much pressure and you movements are slow, the Oobleck behaves as a liquid, but if you use more pressure and have faster movements, the Oobleck acts as a solid.<p/>

  Last week my group and I decided on our final project as a <u>mouse trap car</u>. It uses the power of the mouse trap to pull the rear axle of the car which then powers the car forward. We researched the project, the materials, and the mechanics of the car. Then this week, we measured the parts of the project to make a blue print. With the blue print we made a computer-aided design (CAD) in order to visualize the project with the correct dimensions.

<p>This week we put togther the project. We started with cutting out the cardboard base with the end having a 4 inch cut out to allow for space for the string to be able to wind up the around the axle to create tension for the mouse trap to be able to pull the car forward. Then we glued all the pieces together. We started with gluing the 1 inch pieces of straw to the base to hold the axle, we used the axle to ensure the straws were alined, if we had not alined the straws together, the axle would not be straight which would slow the car down. After the straws were glued down This week we tested our first iteration of our mouse trap car. Our estimated distance traveled is 24 feet and the result was 19 feet. We found that the way we wrap the string around the axle dramatically affected the travel distance. If we wrapped the string tighter together, the distance was about double the distance of if we wrapped the string loosely. We ran the project many times up until we hit a consistant average was about 20 feet. </p>

<p>This week we put together the second iteration of our project. We started with cutting out the cardboard base with the end having a 4-inch cut out to allow for space for the string to be able to wind up around the axle to create tension for the mouse trap to be able to pull the car forward. We cut the wooden skewers for the two axles into 9 inches each, we had to make sure the was enough space for the wheels to not be too close to the cardboard base or as we saw from the first interaction, the wheels would get caught and slow down drastically. The other wooden skewer was 5 inches to be glued onto the mousetrap. We cut the string into 10 inches because if there was too much, the extra string would cause problems such as getting caught in the wheels and axle.  Then we glued all the pieces together. We started by gluing the 1-inch pieces of straw to the base to hold the axle, we used the axle to ensure the straws were aligned, if we had not aligned the straws together, the axle would not be straight which would slow the car down. After the straws were glued down we glued the CD wheels on. We glued the first wheel of each axle and had to make sure the wheel was aligned by putting the CD on top of a duct tape round, making sure the wooden skewer was aligned straight up. Then we tested the second iteration of our mouse trap car. Our estimated distance traveled is 24 feet and the result was 46 feet. We found that the way we wrapped the string around the axle dramatically affected the travel distance. If we wrapped the string tighter together, the distance was about double the distance if we wrapped the string loosely. We ran the project many times up until we hit a consistent average of about 35 feet. </p>

<p>On this week we worked on our egg drop CAD and project. For the research we used a combination of different projects to choose the components of our project. We have a small box made out of cardboard with paper filling the space of the another box inside being slightly larger than the egg. The extra space is filled with cotton balls to support for extra cusion. We also added a parachute made out of a trash bag and straws and popsicle sticks poking out of the box to break the fall. </p>

<p>This week we finished up our egg drop project and tested it. We had mostly finished our project on the previous day but we tested the parachute and we realized that the trash bad we used was too small so we opted for a larger one. Though the larger bag did better than the smaller one, we found through testing that the bad sometimes stayed closed and barely worked so we inflated a ballon and put it into the bag to keep it open, we found that this helped the parachute alot. For the last test, we put the egg inside the box and dropped it from about 2 stories up and it was a success.</p>
